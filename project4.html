        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The "Advanced Security System" is a cutting-edge surveillance project designed to enhance security by detecting unauthorized motion in a room. It sends an SMS alert and a photo of the intruder to the homeowner.</p>
        <P>Additionally, the system is trained to recognize specific faces, and if a recognized person enters the room, it sends a personalized message identifying the individual. This system uses motion detection, facial recognition, and real-time communication technologies to provide a robust security solution.</P>
        
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Motion Detection: Uses sensors to detect any movement within the monitored area.</li>
            <li>SMS Alerts: Sends an immediate SMS notification to the homeowner when motion is detected.</li>
            <li>Intruder Photo Capture: Captures a photo of the person entering the room and sends it to the homeowner.</li>
            <li>Facial Recognition: Identifies pre-trained, selected faces and sends a personalized message when these individuals enter the room.</li>
            <li>Real-Time Monitoring: Provides real-time monitoring and alerts to ensure immediate response.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Raspberry Pi: Serves as the central processing unit for running the security software.</li>
            <li>PIR Motion Sensors: Detects motion within the room.</li>
            <li>Camera Module: Captures photos and video of the detected motion and intruders.</li>
            <li>Facial Recognition Software: Machine learning algorithms trained to recognize specific faces.</li>
            <li>SMS Gateway</li>
            <li>Cloud Storage: Stores captured photos and videos securely.</li>
        </ul>

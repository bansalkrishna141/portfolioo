            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The "Advanced Security System" is a cutting-edge surveillance project designed to enhance security by detecting unauthorized motion in a room. It sends an SMS alert and a photo of the intruder to the homeowner.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the system is trained to recognize specific faces, and if a recognized person enters the room, it sends a personalized message identifying the individual. This system uses motion detection, facial recognition, and real-time communication technologies to provide a robust security solution.</p>

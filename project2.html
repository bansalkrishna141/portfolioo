        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>"FarmBot" is an innovative smart farming assistant designed to revolutionize traditional farming practices. This multifunctional robot assists farmers by detecting plant diseases, sending real-time data, enabling precision spraying of medicine, and automating sowing and harvesting processes.</p> 
        <p>Additionally, it acts as a scarecrow to protect crops from birds and other pests.

</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Disease Detection: Utilizes advanced sensors and machine learning algorithms to detect plant diseases early and accurately.</li>
            <li>Real-Time Data Transmission: Sends real-time data to farmers' mobile devices, allowing them to monitor crop health remotely.</li>
            <li>Precision Spraying: Equipped with a targeted spraying system that allows farmers to apply medicine directly to affected plants, minimizing waste and environmental impact.</li>
            <li>Automated Sowing and Harvesting: Automates the process of sowing seeds and harvesting crops, reducing labor costs and increasing efficiency.</li>
            <li>Scarecrow Functionality: Acts as a scarecrow to deter birds and other pests, protecting the crops without the need for manual intervention.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sensors: High-precision sensors for detecting plant health and environmental conditions.</li>
            <li>Machine Learning: Algorithms to analyze sensor data and accurately diagnose plant diseases.</li>
            <li>Robotics: Automated mechanisms for sowing, spraying, and harvesting crops.</li>
            <li>Wireless Communication: Real-time data transmission to farmers' smartphones or computers via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.</li>
            <li>Solar Power: Solar panels to ensure the FarmBot operates sustainably and autonomously.</li>
        </ul>
